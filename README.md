# GridWorld

This is a practice work in the course of Reinforcement Learning at Sorbonne.

I used Reinforcement Learning to solve the GridWorld game. I used two algorithms : Value Iteration and Policy Iteration. There is also a Random Iteration just for test.

In order to run this program, You just need to run the `main.py`. Then, you can choose what kind of algorithm to use for the Agent.
